## UI/UX
The design of SwitchGamesShowcase focuses on simplicity and intuitive user experience, ensuring gamers can easily browse and review games. The UI draws inspiration from the walkthrough project to provide a social media-like platform treatment that feels familiar.

### Agile Methodology 
Agile method was followed during the development of the site to ensure the best outcome through iterative progress. This approach enabled us to adapt to changes, prioritize features effectively, and ensure the end product meets user expectations.
I utilized a Kanban board to track progress, manage features, and address user stories effectively. You can view the Kanban board and follow the development journey [here](https://github.com/users/sakixchy/projects/10/).
